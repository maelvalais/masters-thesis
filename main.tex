\section{The need for sparse representations}

A sparse signal over some representation means that it can be written with as few information as possible â€“ in other words, sparse means with many zeros. Many applications ranging from machine learning to image denoising heavily rely on the property that we can summarize (or more exactly approximate) any signal using a proper sparse representation. The job of obtaining the raw\footnote{Any raw signal is actually represented by the canonical basis} signal from its sparse counterpart takes the form of an operator, often called dictionary or transform.

This chapter will review the main existing dictionaries that have been used for sparse representation, from non-adaptative transforms to learned dictionaries and through the intermediate over-complete dictionaries.

\section{Basis dictionaries}

The Fourier transform is a classical example of operators used for sparsity. In figure \ref{fig_fourier}, the left picture $\y$ has been represented using a Fourier basis, which can be written as a matrix $\D$. The right picture shows the coefficients $\x$ such that
$$\D^T\y = \x$$

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\subcaptionbox{Picture $\y$ with many discontinuities.}%

 \subcaptionbox{Result of applying the Fourier transform to $\y$}%
  [.49\linewidth]{\includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{figures/exple_fourier_frequen.pdf}}
  \caption{Decomposition $\D^T\y=\x$ of a signal $\y$ using the dictionary $\D$ made of Fourier series. In $\x$, the middle coefficients are coding "large" features while the corner values are coding the details. The multiple white lines, ranging from the middle to the borders, outline the discontinuities caused by the blackboard edges; these coefficients are scattered (hence not sparse), which shows that the Fourier basis has representation problems in presence of discontinuities.} \label{fig_fourier}
\end{figure}

However, the Fourier transform is quite different from the representations we have in mind, namely the convolutional tree structure. First, it is a linear mapping and its corresponding matrix forms a basis. This representation is one-to-one in the sense that every code $\x$ is associated with a unique image $\y$. This basis is also orthogonal, meaning that the operator is stable (it does not amplify errors). % TODO Finally, the basis is normed, meaning that...

More importantly, Fourier has interesting properties that allow fast implementations. For example, applying the Matlab function \texttt{fft2} to the \cref{fig_fourier} is extremely fast. If we assume $N$ to be the dimension of the concatenated\footnotemark[1] image, instead of computing a time-expensive $O(N^2)$ matrix-vector product, the fast Fourier transform only requires a $O(NlogN)$ computational cost.

\footnotetext[1]{For easier reading, we consider images as one-dimensional vectors. A $16 \times 16$ image would give a vector of dimension 256.}


The Fourier transform is widely used as an operator for sparse representations, mainly when dealing with smooth signals that can be approximated by a sum of sinusoids. However, this operator does not generally perform well on images since they contain many discontinuities that are far from being representable using sinusoids.

As an example, most of the coefficients of the code $\x$ in \cref{fig_fourier} are non-zero. The worst performance happens on the edges of the blackboard: the white vertical and horizontal lines that are full of high-value coefficients are trying to code the discontinuity, which is difficult to obtain with a Fourier basis.

Along with Fourier, many other non-adaptative dictionaries exist; we can mention the cosine transform which is at the core of JPEG compression. We can also cite the wavelet transform, used in JPEG2000 compression (for movies in theaters), and the curvelet transform, which is more tolerant to non-smooth images. Note that fast implementations are also available for wavelet and curvelet transforms.


\section{Frame-based dictionaries}

The basis-based dictionaries were generalized by using multiple bases to form an over-complete dictionary (called \emph{frame}) in \cite{chen_atomic_2001}. For example, combining a canonical basis with a cosine basis would allow to represent both peaks and sinusoids.

This method, although offering excellent performances for compressed sensing thanks to the fast implementations of the concatenated bases, still lacks adaptativity. Another approach coming from the data-science community adresses this problem: the dictionary learning.

\section{Learned dictionaries}

Like fixed-basis frames, learned dictionaries are over-complete. Instead of being fixed, atoms are based on a learning set of sample images
$$\Y = \begin{bmatrix} \y_1 & \dots & \y_S \end{bmatrix}$$
where $\Y$ is the concatenation of $S$ column vectors $\y_i$ (the images) of dimension $N$. The dictionary $\D$ is made of $K$ columns $\d_i$ (the atoms) such that the number of atoms is way larger than the dimension of a single image $\y_i$ ($ \gg K \gg N$):
$$\D = \begin{bmatrix} \d_1 & \dots & \d_K \end{bmatrix}$$

The codes $\X$ are defined by
$$\X = \begin{bmatrix} \x_1 & \dots & \x_S \end{bmatrix}$$
where $\X$ is the concatenation of $S$ column vectors $\x_i$ (the codes) of dimension $K$. The dictionary learning problem is defined as
\begin{align}
\underset{\D,\X}{\min}~ \lambda \lVert \X \rVert_1 + \lVert \D\X-\Y \rVert^2_F \tag{$DL$} \label{eq_dl}
\end{align}
where $\lVert . \rVert_F$ denotes the Frobenius norm and $\lVert . \rVert_1$ is the $l_1$ norm defined by $\lVert \X \rVert_1 = \sum_{i,j} |\x_i|$.

Many algorithms solving \eqref{eq_dl} alternatively optimize the dictionary $\D$ and the codes $\X$ so that atoms of $\D$ generate the sparsest representation $\x_i$ approximating the sample $\y_i$ for all $i = 1,\dots,S$:
$$\D\X \approx \Y$$

\Cref{fig_overcomplete_matrix} gives an idea of what it means to approximate an image $\y$ using the matrix-vector product of a sparse code $\x$ and a learned dictionary $\D$. For this example, $\y$ is represented by a linear combination of three atoms of $\D$: $\x$ is 3-sparse.

\begin{figure}[!ht] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{figures/sparsity-matrix.pdf}
\caption{Matrix view of $\D\x$ when $\D$ is over-complete (much more columns than lines).}\label{fig_overcomplete_matrix}
\end{figure}



\section{The K-SVD algorithm}

Among the many existing alternating algorithms for dictionary learning like the Online dictionary learning algorithm or the K-means algorithm, the \ac{KSVD} algorithm is well known for its state-of-the-art performances in image denoising. Introduced in \cite{aharon_k-svd:_2006}, K-SVD is responsible for many concepts behind the PALMTREE algorithm developed in \cite{chabiron_optimization_2016}. This section summarizes the key elements of the K-SVD algorithm.

\ac{KSVD} does not actually solve \eqref{eq_dl}; instead, it gives a solution for a "stronger" problem in the sense that the level of sparsity in K-SVD is enforced by $\gamma$ in
\begin{align*}
\underset{\D,\X}{\min}~ & \lVert \D\X-\Y \rVert^2_F \tag{$DL_2$}\label{eq_dl_ksvd} \\
s.t.~& \lVert \x_i \rVert_0 \le \gamma \quad \forall i \text{ in } 1,\dots,S
\end{align*}
where $\lVert . \rVert_F$ denotes the Frobenius norm and $\lVert . \rVert_0$ is the pseudo-norm $l_0$ (also known as "counting function").

The \emph{Sparse Coding step} optimizes along $\x$; this step basically uses OMP \cref{alg_omp} or any other pursuit algorithm. The \emph{Dictionary Update step} optimizes along $\D$. This is the step the authors of \cite{chabiron_optimization_2016} worked on. Note that the full K-SVD algorithm is in \cref{sec_ksvd}, \cpageref{sec_ksvd}.



% TODO add KSVD example of image

\subsection{Atoms scalability}
As the learned K-SVD dictionary relies on the $O(NK)$ matrix-vector product and that it must be over-complete ($K \gg N$) in order to achieve sparsity, we easily understand that $N$ cannot be big. When implemented, the K-SVD the sample images (also called patches) and atoms of the dictionary are generally at most $16 \times 16$. 

Dictionaries with bigger atoms are known as multi-resolution (also called multi-scale), meaning that the atoms can contain either details or large features in images.

[Talk about \cite{magoarou_learning_2015} (Elad team) and \cite{sulam_trainlets:_2016} (Gribonval team)]

\subsection{Atoms redundancy} \label{sec_atoms_redund}
The K-SVD algorithm is not translation-invariant in the sense that multiple atoms of the dictionary can have the same detail but slightly translated. The authors of \cite{mailhe_shift-invariant_2008} worked on making the update step invariant by translation, but it still needs a lot of tuning and finding the right parameters. 

Translation-invariant transforms are known as convolutional dictionaries. The convolution is basically the idea of trying to match the atom to every possible location of the image.

Many state-of-the-art machine learning techniques are based on trees of convolutions, like the Convolutional Neural Networks used in Deep learning \cite{lecun_deep_2015}.


\chapter{State of the art}

\section{Convolutional dictionaries}
[Didn't I say everything in \cref{sec_atoms_redund}???]

\section{The PALMTREE algorithm}

\subsection{Dictionary-as-a-tree model \label{sec_tree_model}}
The work studied in \cite{chabiron_toward_2015} and \cite{chabiron_optimization_2016} offers a different way of structuring the matrix $\D$. Instead of using "plain" atoms as columns and dealing with the matrix-vector product in $O(NK)$, $\D$ is defined by a convolutional tree structure $\T(\V,\E)$ where each edge $e$ of $\E$ is characterized by a kernel $\h^e$ and a support $\s^e$. The root $r$ and leaves $l$ of $\V$ allow to define a branch as the successive edges growing from the root to one of the leaves.

\begin{figure}[!ht]\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/tree.pdf}
\caption{View of a convolutional tree; the $\h^e$ and $\s^e$ are what define $\D$}\label{fig_tree}
\end{figure}

The target image $\y$ as well as the kernels $\h^e$ and supports $\s^e$ are vectors of dimension $N$. The supports $\s^e$ are only made of 0 (corresponding value in $\h^e$ must be 0) or 1 (corresponding value in $\h^e$ can be non-zero).

The figure \ref{fig_example_kernel} displays examples of a standard kernel (left) and a kernel $\h^e$ (middle) associated with its support $\s^e$ (right). The gray squares represent the "ones" of the support while the kernel is represented by values.

\begin{figure}[!ht]\centering
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.20\textwidth}\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{figures/kernel-exple.pdf}
\caption{Averaging kernel: fixed support and values}\label{fig_example_kernel}
\end{subfigure}
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.79\textwidth}\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{figures/kernel-h_e.pdf}
\caption{Kernel $\h^e$ (left) and its associated support $\s^e$ (right)}\label{fig_example_kernel}
\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

One atom of the dictionary $\D$ corresponds to the convolution of successive kernels on a given branch identified by the leaf $l$. We will denote that successive convolution by
$$\h^{*l} = \h^r * \dots * \h^l$$

Using the matrix notation\footnote{See \cref{sec_matrix_vs_tree}}, the dictionary-as-a-tree $\D$ applied to a code $\x$ approximates $\y$ as follows
$$\D\x \approx \y$$

The code $\x$ is a "big" vector of dimension $K$ with $K = N \times Leaves$; $\D$ is a matrix of dimensions $N \times K$ and $\y$ is a vector of dimension $N$. 

Showing that $\D$ can be written as a matrix allows to compare the performance of this dictionary against a simple matrix-vector product (see \cref{sec_matrix_vs_tree}). Here is the dictionary-as-a-tree way of computing $\D\x$:

\begin{align}
	\D\x = \sum_{l \in \L} \x^l * \h^{*l}	 \label{eq_Dx_as_convolution}
\end{align}

$\D\x$ can be seen as a polynomial of degree $2 \times \text{depth}(\T)$. This implies that it is possibly extremely non-convex although being infinitely differentiable.

\subsection{The (FTL) problem}

The dictionary update step is defined as 
\begin{align}
\underset{\substack{(\h^e)_{e}}}\min ~ & \lVert \D\x - \y \rVert_2^2 \tag{$FTL$} \label{eq_ftl}\\
\text{s.t.~} & \s^e_p=0 \Rightarrow \h^e_p = 0 \quad & \forall p=1,\dots,N ,~\forall e \in \E \label{eq_ftl_in_support} \\
 & \lVert \h^e \rVert \le \gamma & \forall e \in \E\label{eq_ftl_kernel_finite_nrj}
\end{align}

The constraint \ref{eq_ftl_in_support} guarantees that each kernel $\h^e$ has its non-zero values on the points of its support $\s^e$. Constraint \ref{eq_ftl_kernel_finite_nrj} makes sure that the overall energy of every support is finite and prevents a specific kernel to "explode".

\eqref{eq_ftl} can be rewritten as an unconstrained problem, shifting the constraint spaces $(\Dspace^e)_{e \in \E}$ to the objective function using the characteristic function $\chi_{\Dspace^e}$ defined for one edge $e$ as
$$\chi_{\Dspace^e}(\h^e) = \begin{cases} 0 &\text{ if } \h^e \in \Dspace^e \\ +\infty & \ \text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$

\eqref{eq_ftl} can then be rewritten as
\begin{align}
\underset{\substack{(\h^e)_{e}}}\min ~ & \lVert \D\x - \y \rVert_2^2 + \sum_{e}\chi_{D_e} (\h^e) \tag{$FTL_2$} \label{eq_ftl2}
\end{align}

For later references, the objective function of \eqref{eq_ftl} will be denoted as
\begin{align}
\Phi((\h^e)_{e \in \E}) = \lVert \D\x-\y \rVert^2_2
\end{align}

\subsection{The PALMTREE algorithm}

\subsection{Drawbacks}
As explained in \cite[p. 23]{chabiron_optimization_2016}, the main drawbacks to use this convolutional tree model for practical dictionary learning (as many other applications) are the hand-made parts of the model, leading to arbitrary and sub-optimal results. Among them are the design of the tree (degree, depth...) and the choice of the supports. % TODO "degree" not understandable
\subsubsection{Choice of the tree}
The paper chooses to use a fixed tree structure, meaning that the tree (degree, depth) has been created \emph{ad-hoc} on a per-experiment basis, trying to mimic the frequency pyramid tiling of a curvelet decomposition. The number of leaves wasalso specifically chosen to match the number of atoms that was generated on the target image.

But getting an actual adaptative dictionary update step implies that designing the tree is made optimally and as part of the optimization process. This is one of the internship research axis.

\subsubsection{Choice of the kernel supports}

As described in \cref{sec_tree_model}, the supports $\s^e$ are part of the dictionary-as-a-tree model. In \cite{chabiron_toward_2015}, the authors experimentally showed that using fixed supports for approximating curvelets is possible. For that specific purpose, the results turned to be good. But the whole model was supposed to be able to approximate any kind of image, hence the need for "adaptative" supports instead of hand-made ones. Figure \ref{fig_example_kernel} shows in dashed-line squares the hand-made support. The gray square show what we would expect from an "adaptive" support. Instead of keeping the same shape for every target atom, the supports evolves and get closer to the target shape.

And as for the tree design, the choice of where are located the elements of each kernel support has been made (so far) arbitrarily. The support of the $\h^e$ kernel of fig. \ref{fig_example_kernel} shows an example of typical layout chosen for the experiments in \cite{chabiron_optimization_2016}. 

However, our goal is to be able to approximate any kind of atoms, as \ac{KSVD} is able to do. Being able to choose what elements should be in the kernel supports as part of the optimization process is another goal during this internship.

\section{Learning the supports}
[todo: I explain what my contribution will be...]

\Cref{fig_fixed_vs_expected} shows an example of what we think would happen when allowing to add and remove elements: the support would shape itself to better match the target atom (in fig.\ref{fig_fixed_vs_expected}, the atom shown is actually the whole target image).

\section{Optimization of supports}

[redo: After being able to correctly add and remove support elements, the second phase was to think about what elements we would add or remove, and when (i.e. when during the PALMTREE algorithm).]


\subsection{Adding an element}
[redo: Our first thought on how to add an element to a support was to find the best kernel among the tree edges, and then pick the best point(s) of that support to be added. We thought the gradient of the objective function would probably give that information.]

\section{Experiment protocol}
The follwing experiments are using a fixed single-branch tree of depth 4 (see fig. \ref{fig_gain_n4}). The gain-per-added-point matrix is always computed with respect to one of the four supports $\s^e$.

\section{Using the gradient for adding support elements}

The Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP, detailed in \cref{alg_omp}) chooses which component $\x_i$ should be "turned on" at each iteration, finding the atom $d_i$ that has the greatest correlation with the residual $R$. This step (cf. \cref{alg_omp_pick_correlation}) uses the gradient $\nabla \Phi(\x)$, with $$\Phi(\x) = \lVert \D\x - \y \rVert^2$$


\begin{algorithm}[!ht]
    \caption{Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm for sparse approximation}\label{alg_omp}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Input signal $\y$ of dimension $N$, dictionary of dim $N \times K$ with $K \gg N$

    \While{$i \leq k$}
      \State $l =  \underset{l = 1,\dots,l}{\arg\max} | \nabla \Phi(\x) |$ \label{alg_omp_pick_correlation}\Comment{find atom with max. correlation with $R$}
      \State $S = S \cup \{l\}$
      \State $\x = \underset{supp(\x) \subset S}{\arg\max} \Phi(\x)$
      \State $\bm{r}^{(i+1)} = \bm{r}^{(i)}-\x_l^T \d_l^{(i)}$
      \State $\hat{\y} = \hat{\y}+\langle \bm{r}^{(i)}, \d_{l}^{(i)} \rangle \d_{l}^{(i)}$
      \State $i = i + 1$
    \EndWhile
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Our idea is to use the same principle when adding elements to supports $(\s^e)_{e \in \E}$: add a new element to one of the supports between two iterations of the PALMTREE algorithm, using the greatest gradient component information.

But is it actually correct to choose the element to be added using a strictly local information (the gradient)? Also, how to get the "full" gradient as the current gradient is only computed on the points of the support?

We will first review how the "full" gradient is computed and then describe a way to check that the gradient gives a good direction towards a critical point.


\subsection{Computing the "full" gradient}
Up to now, the gradient was computed using a convolution based on translations. It takes advantage of the sparsity of each kernel $\h^e$ as well as the fact that the proximal operator is projecting every kernel onto its support, meaning that only a few elements have to be computed.

We basically chose to use the fast Fourier transform ($\F$) for computing the convolution on the whole kernels:
\begin{align*}
	\nabla_{\h^f} \Phi((\h^e)_{e \in \E})&= \F^{-1}(\F(H^{e'})^* \text{.\^{}} \F(R))
\end{align*}
with ${}^*$ denoting the adjoint operator, $\text{.\^{}}$ the point-wise product, $\h^{f}$ the (todo) % TODO H^e?

\subsection{Is the gradient right?}
We had some trouble when trying to compute the gradient on the full kernels $(\h^e)_{e \in \E}$ (not only on the supports element locations). To be sure that the computed "full" gradient was correct, we compared it to a finite-diffences gradient:

$$\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{\Phi((\h^e)_{e \in \E}+\epsilon e_i) - \Phi ((\h^e)_{e \in \E}) }{\epsilon} ~\overset{?}{=}~ \nabla_i \Phi ((\h^e)_{e \in \E})$$

\begin{figure}[!ht]\centering
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.30\textwidth}\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/verif_gradient/gradient.png}
\end{subfigure}
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.30\textwidth}\centering

\end{subfigure}
\caption{Checking that the "full" gradient is correct. We compare it to the finite-difference gradient and make the $\epsilon$ tend to 0.} \label{fig_verif_gradient}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig_verif_gradient} compares the FFT-computed gradient to the finite-differences gradient (with $\epsilon=0.001$). The bottom left figure shows that the two gradients are very close in term of difference. The right figure shows that the finite-differences gradient converges to the "full" gradient, which confirms that our "full" gradient is correct.

\subsection{The ideal elements to be added}\label{sec_gain_per_added_point}

One way to know if the "full" gradient leads to a good solution after many iterations, we designed the \cref{alg_gain_per_added_point} that tries every possible point added to one of the supports and see how much the objective function decreases. We named the resulting matrix \emph{gain-per-added-point} with the notation $\g^f$ ($f$ is the edge of the studied support).

$\g^f$ represents for each point $p \in \P$ the minimized objective function if an element were added on support kernel $\s^f$ at that specific location (cf. \cref{alg_gain_per_added_point}).

\begin{algorithm}[!ht]
    \caption{Gain-per-added-point for the support $\s^f$} \label{alg_gain_per_added_point}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Input One chosen edge $f$ and a tree $\T$
    \Output $\g^f$, the gain per added point for support $\s^f$
    \State $(\k^e)_{e \in \E} = \underset{(\h^e)_{e \in \E}}{\arg\min}~ \Phi ((\h^e)_{e \in \E})$ \quad s.t.~$\h^e \in \Dspace^e$ \quad $\forall e \in \E$ \Comment{common starting point}
    \For{each point $p \in \P$}
    	\State $\s^f_p = 1$ \Comment{add element to support}
    	\State $\g^f_p = \underset{(\k^e)_{e \in \E}}{\min}~ \Phi ((\k^e)_{e \in \E})$ \quad s.t.~$\k^e \in \Dspace^e$ \quad $\forall e \in \E$
    	\State $\s^f_p = 0$ \Comment{remove element to support}
    \EndFor
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\Cref{fig_gain_n4} compares (c) the gain-per-added-point of $\s^4$ to (d) the absolute value of the partial gradient w.r.t $\h^4$ after a full minimization. It is interesting to see that they share the same direction and shape. After selecting 20 of their best values in (e) and (f), we notice that they almost match, which reinforces our hypothesis that the gradient could give the right information for widening supports.

\end{figure}

The experiment shown in \cref{fig_before_after_adding} is based on the results of \cref{fig_gain_n4_approx}, where figures (a,b,d,e,g,h) are the same as the previous experiment. The figures (c,j,i) show what  happens if we add the minimum point of gain-per-added-point to $\s^4$ and continue the minimization.

In the "before" gradient (\cref{fig_grad_before}) every point of the support (the small squares) has a null gradient: in the direction of those nine points, the gradient is null, meaning that we are at an critical point.

We can observe that adding a point to the support (materialized by the \nth{10} small square), the highest gradient values "shift" to the south-west. Adding a point to the support has an effect on every surrounding points.

\subsection{Local versus far away information}

The experiment in \cref{fig_gain_n4} has only been done on a fully minimized tree, meaning that the gain-per-added-point would be "close" to what the gradient would indicate. But we could wonder if the gradient stays the same throughout all iterations; compared to the converged gain-per-added-point which is a "far away" information, the gradient might not lead to that gain.

The experiment shown in \cref{fig_iter_gain_vs_grad} compares the best values of gain-per-added-point to gradients snapshots taken during the minimization. This is reassuring: whatever the iteration, the gradient best values keep close to the gain-per-added-point best values.

\section{Link between convolutional tree and matrix $\D$} \label{sec_matrix_vs_tree}

Figure \ref{fig_block_circular} outlines the relation between the tree and the matrix form. The dictionary can be written using the notation

$$\D = \begin{bmatrix}C^5 & C^6\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}C^1 & C^2 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 0 & C^3 & C^4\end{bmatrix}$$
with $C^i$ the block-circular matrix for $\h^i$; it represents the final convolution $\h^{*l}*\x^l$ when using matrices.

\section{Why is sparse coding used for denoising?}

The figure \ref{sparse_reduce_noise} shows a noisy signal $\y$ living in a high-dimensional $N$ and defined by
$$\y=\hat{\y} + \bm{b}$$
with $b$ following a centered Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2I)$ and $\hat{\y}$ the noise-less signal. We see that the distance $||b||$ is always lower than the projected distance.

This is because the deviation in the $N$ dimensional space can be written as
\begin{align*}
\sigma^2(b) =& \mathbb{E}\left[\lVert b-\mathbb{E}(b) \rVert^2 \right]\\
=& \mathbb{E}\left(\lVert b \rVert^2 \right)\\
=& ... \\ % TODO finish useless proof
=& \frac{1}{N}\lVert b \rVert^2
\end{align*}
which gives 
$$ \lVert b \rVert = \sigma\sqrt{N} $$
When projected to the $K$ dimensional space, the noise deviation becomes
$$\lVert b \rVert = \sigma\sqrt{K} $$
which is much better than the previous distance, provided that $K \gg N$. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/sparse-reduce-noise.pdf}
\caption{When projected onto a lower dimensional space, the standard derivation of the additive Gaussian noise $b \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ will be greatly reduced if $K \gg N$. The sparser the representation the better the denoising. \label{sparse_reduce_noise}}
