Many image processing techniques are based on... representing the signal ...

We aim... 

Now that it has been proven that the objective function, although non-convex, actually allows to find local minimums that are close enough to the actual minimum.


The idea behind dictionaries
Say $y$ is a signal we want to ...
We want to find a transform/dictionary D such that, when applied to a code (think of the "transformed" signal) will give an approximated signal $\hat{y}$:

$$D\alpha=\hat{y} \approx y$$

In this work, we will generally stay on the non-noisy case, leaving noisiness to further work.

In dictionary learning, we call the columns of $D$ the \emph{atoms}.
